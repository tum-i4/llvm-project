   These are in-progress notes for the upcoming LLVM 13 release.
   Release notes for previous releases can be found on
   `the Download Page <https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`_.


Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,
release 13.0.0.  Here we describe the status of LLVM, including major improvements
from the previous release, improvements in various subprojects of LLVM, and
some of the current users of the code.  All LLVM releases may be downloaded
from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about LLVM, including information about the latest
release, please check out the `main LLVM web site <https://llvm.org/>`_.  If you
have questions or comments, the `LLVM Developer's Mailing List
<https://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-dev>`_ is a good place to send
them.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the main
LLVM web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not the current
one.  To see the release notes for a specific release, please see the `releases
page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
=================================================
.. NOTE
   For small 1-3 sentence descriptions, just add an entry at the end of
   this list. If your description won't fit comfortably in one bullet
   point (e.g. maybe you would like to give an example of the
   functionality, or simply have a lot to talk about), see the `NOTE` below
   for adding a new subsection.


.. NOTE
   If you would like to document a larger change, then you can add a
   subsection about it right here. You can copy the following boilerplate
   and un-indent it (the indentation causes it to be inside this comment).

   Special New Feature
   -------------------

   Makes programs 10x faster by doing Special New Thing.

* Windows Control-flow Enforcement Technology: the ``-ehcontguard`` option now
  emits valid unwind entrypoints which are validated when the context is being
  set during exception handling.

Changes to the LLVM IR
----------------------

* ...


Changes to building LLVM
------------------------

Changes to TableGen
-------------------

* The new "TableGen Programmer's Reference" replaces the "TableGen Language
  Introduction" and "TableGen Language Reference" documents.

* The syntax for specifying an integer range in a range list has changed.
  The old syntax used a hyphen in the range (e.g., ``{0-9}``). The new syntax
  uses the "`...`" range punctuation (e.g., ``{0...9}``). The hyphen syntax
  is deprecated.

Changes to the AArch64 Backend
--------------------------

During this release ...

* Lots of improvements to generation of Windows unwind data; the unwind
  data is optimized and written in packed form where possible, reducing
  the size of unwind data (pdata and xdata sections) by around 60%
  compared with LLVM 11. The generation of prologs/epilogs is tweaked
  when targeting Windows, to increase the chances of being able to use
  the packed unwind info format.

* Support for creating Windows unwind data using ``.seh_*`` assembler
  directives.

* Produce proper assembly output for the Windows target, including
  ``:lo12:`` relocation specifiers, to allow the assembly output
  to actually be assembled.

* Changed the assembly comment string for MSVC targets to ``//`` (consistent
  with the MinGW and ELF targets), freeing up ``;`` to be used as
  statement separator.

Changes to the ARM Backend
--------------------------

During this release ...

Changes to the MIPS Target
--------------------------

During this release ...


Changes to the PowerPC Target
-----------------------------

Optimization:

* Made improvements to loop unroll-and-jam including fix to respect user
  provided #pragma unroll-and-jam for loops on targets other than ARM.
* Improved PartialInliner allowing it to handle code regions in a switch
  statements.
* Improved PGO support on AIX by building and linking with compiler-rt profile
  library.
* Add support for Epilogue Vectorization and enabled it by default.

CodeGen:

* POWER10 support
  * Implementation of PC Relative addressing in LLD including the associated
    linker optimizations.
  * Add support for the new matrix multiplication (MMA) instructions to Clang
    and LLVM.
  * Implementation of Power10 builtins.

* Scheduling enhancements
  * Add a new algorithm to cluster more loads/stores if the DAG is not too
    complicated.
  * Enable the PowerPC scheduling heuristic for Power10.

* Target dependent passes tuning
  * Enhance LoopStrengthReduce/PPCLoopInstrFormPrep pass for PowerPC,
    especially for P10 intrinsics.
  * Enhance machine combiner pass to reduce register pressure for PowerPC.
  * Improve MachineSink to do more sinking based on register pressure and alias
    analysis.

* General improvements
  * Complete the constrained floating point operations support.
  * Improve the llvm-exegesis support.
  * Improve the stack clash protection to probe the gap between stackptr and
    realigned stackptr.
  * Improve the IEEE long double support for Power8.
  * Enable MemorySSA for LoopSink.
  * Enhance LLVM debugging functionality via options such as -print-changed and
    -print-before-changed.
  * Add builtins for Power9 (i.e. darn, xvtdiv, xvtsqrt etc).
  * Add options to disable all or part of LoopIdiomRecognizePass.
  * Add support for printing the DDG in DOT form allowing for visual inspection
    of the Data Dependence Graph.
  * Remove the QPX support.
  * Significant number of bug fixes including all the fixes necessary to
    achieve a clean test run for Julia.

AIX Support:

* Compiler-rt support
  * Add support for building compiler-rt for AIX and 32-bit Power targets.
  * Made compiler-rt the default rtlib for AIX.

* General Improvements
  * Enable the AIX extended AltiVec ABI under option -mabi=vec-extabi.
  * Add partial C99 complex type support.
  * Implemente traceback table for functions (encodes vector information,
    emits exception handling).
  * Implemente code generation for C++ dynamic initialization and finalization.
    of non-local variables for use with the -bcdtors option of the AIX linker.
  * Add new option -mignore-xcoff-visibility.
  * Enable explicit sections on AIX.
  * Enable -f[no-]data-sections on AIX and set -fdata-sections to be the default
    on AIX.
  * Enable -f[no-]function-sections.
  * Add support for relocation generation using the large code model.
  * Add pragma align natural and sorted out pragma pack stack effect.
